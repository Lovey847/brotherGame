===================

This is a game I made for my little brother roughly a week before his birthday.

That being said, this code is very messy since I didn't have enough time to make it nice.

This was built on top of a framework I had written previously for writing games, I don't think it's very good though.

There are a lot of TODO's that I'm not gonna bother with, as I plan on writing a more data-oriented framework for games.

There is only a linux X11 OpenGL platform layer, I have an ALSA audio layer but it's unused since I never implemented any audio state.

This repository comes with the game data, which is automatically built by 2 generators in the CMake build system.

This repository also comes with tons of unused source files, such as linux_pak and linux_save, back when I didn't wanna assume the target platform had a filesystem.

The atlases come with an alpha component despite the renderer not having any alpha blending.

I know in 3D games you're not really supposed to use texture atlases, but I was familiar with them and only had a week to write this so I sacrificed mipmapping to write it faster.

Feel free to fork if, for some reason, you wanna make any modifications! (Such as an SDL platform layer or something)

I know that I can build this on my machine, I have no guarantee you'll be able to build this on your machine, even if it's the target platform. Even if you're able to build, I've done no testing and have no guarantee it'll work on any other machine but mine.

Yeah, I know that I'm doing "!m_state->r.atlas" in game/game.cpp, which is an array and will always evaluate to true, but I can't really be bothered to fix it.

Not accepting any pull requests.
